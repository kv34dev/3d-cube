# 3D Cube

**3D Cube** is a simple yet visually engaging web demo built with **Three.js**.  
It showcases a smooth 3D animation of a rotating and floating cube rendered with realistic lighting effects. The project demonstrates the basics of working with 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL.

The cube continuously rotates and moves up and down in space, while the background color alternates between light and dark, creating a dynamic visual rhythm.

Additionally, you can **change the cube’s color** by clicking anywhere on the screen — each click generates a completely new random color.

You can view and interact with the live version of this project via the link in the **About** section of this repository.
